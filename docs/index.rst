Hi! My name's Aidan McNay (`acm289 <mailto:acm289@cornell.edu>`_), and I'm
currently a M.Eng. student at Cornell University enrolled in ECE 5160:
Fast Robots. I'm looking forward to being able to connect my previous
experiences in programming and microcontrollers to real-world applications
and interactions.
